# LouiseNet
LousieNet automates the process of extracting interactions among different components present in a PDB file based upon their shared buried interfaces calculated by the PISA web portal. Next, LouiseNet performs the fundamental network analysis of the macromolecular machinesâ€™ structures based upon the interactions observed between the PDB chains using PISA.
